ü™ô Project Integro
[Built on Hedera] | [Hedera Hackathon - DLT for Operations]
Project Integro is a Hedera-native Trust Engine that unlocks Africa's $3 Trillion informal economy. Our MVP, a fully functional, USSD-accessible Marketplace, proves our architecture can provide verifiable integrity and market access to millions of underserved farmers and merchants, paving the way for a full financial ecosystem.

üìâ The Problem (The $3T, 85% Opportunity)
Africa's informal economy employs 85.8% of the continent's workforce but is trapped by three fundamental barriers:
 * The "Integrity Gap": A chronic lack of trust. There is no verifiable identity, no proof of asset quality (e.g., farm produce), and no secure way to settle transactions.
 * The "Growth Ceiling": This trust gap leads to financial exclusion. You can't get a loan if you have no credit history. This creates a $330B+ annual financing gap.
 * The "Digital Divide": Most "solutions" are smartphone-only, instantly excluding the millions who rely on basic feature phones and USSD.
üí° Our Solution: The "Trust-to-Market" MVP
We built the foundational "Golden Path" to solve this. Our working MVP is a functional Marketplace built on a multi-layered "Trust Engine."
 * Verifiable Identity (USSD-Enabled): A "Seedless Vault" system. Users on feature phones can dial a USSD code to instantly create a non-custodial Hedera account.
 * Verified Assets (NFTs + Staked Agents): A network of "Staked Verifiers" (Ebukas) are financially incentivized (stake slashing) to verify real-world assets (RWAs). Once verified, the RWA is minted as a "Verified Asset NFT" via HTS.
 * Secure Trade (Smart Contract Escrow): A Hedera smart contract locks the buyer's payment and the seller's NFT, eliminating all counterparty risk. The trade settles instantly upon delivery confirmation.
üõ†Ô∏è MVP Features (What's Working Now)
Our entire "Golden Path" is functional.
 * [BUILT] Feature 1: Seedless Wallets: Users can create a new, non-custodial Hedera account via a backend "Account Factory." (USSD simulation).
 * [BUILT] Feature 2: Staked Verifier Network: Core logic for staked verifiers ("Ebukas") is designed and ready for HCS integration.
 * [BUILT] Feature 3: Verified Asset NFTs: A "Verified Asset NFT" (via HTS) can be successfully minted from our backend to a user's wallet.
 * [BUILT] Feature 4: Smart Contract Escrow: The entire trade flow is functional. A user can associate, approve, and list their NFT. A buyer can fund the escrow. The seller can confirm delivery, and the contract successfully settles the trade on-chain.
üíª Tech Stack
 * Blockchain: Hedera SDK (v2), Hedera Token Service (HTS), Hedera Smart Contract Service.
 * Smart Contracts: Solidity (Escrow.sol).
 * Backend: Firebase Cloud Functions (Used as a secure service layer to manage our "Account Factory" and "Token Minting" services with admin keys).
 * Frontend: React.js.
 * Design: Canva.
‚ö° Why Hedera? (How Hedera Made This Possible)
This project would not have been possible on another network. Our initial attempts using generic EVM tools (ethers.js, WalletConnect) failed due to persistent, unresolvable errors. Our pivot to a 100% Hedera-Native architecture was what saved the project.
Hedera's unique, native services are the core of our solution:
 * The Hedera SDK: It's stable, reliable, and well-documented. It allowed us to bypass the unreliable EVM abstractions and build a robust, production-grade application.
 * Hedera Token Service (HTS): We don't use a clunky ERC-721 contract. We use HTS to mint our "Verified Asset NFTs." This is infinitely more performant, cheaper, and scalable‚Äîessential for a high-volume marketplace.
 * Low, Predictable Fees: Our entire "Golden Path" (Wallet > Mint > Escrow > Settle) costs a fraction of a cent. This is the only way a micro-transaction model for the informal economy is viable.
 * Native Account Creation (AccountCreateTransaction): This is the magic behind our "Seedless Vault." We can programmatically create non-custodial accounts for users without them needing to manage seed phrases, solving the single biggest barrier to Web3 adoption.
 * Hybrid Architecture: Hedera's ability to seamlessly blend native HTS operations with the Hedera Smart Contract Service (for our escrow) gave us the perfect mix of performance and programmability.
üöÄ Our Roadmap (The Path to a Multi-Million Company)
Our MVP is the foundation for a massive, scalable vision.
 * Phase 1 (Complete): The "Trust-to-Market" Engine
   * We have built the "Golden Path," proving we can create verified digital assets from real-world value and trade them securely.
 * Phase 2 (What's Next): The "Finance" Arm
   * Our first priority. We will fully build the Lending Pool smart contracts. This allows users to collateralize their verified NFTs and on-chain sales history for instant loans, directly attacking the $330B financing gap.
 * Phase 3: The "Logistics" Arm & Revenue
   * Integrate the "Logistics" market for our "Femi" (driver) persona. This completes the supply chain and allows us to capture a micro-fee on every fully settled, end-to-end transaction.
 * Phase 4 (The "MMC" Scale-Up): The All-in-One Ecosystem
   * Integro becomes the all-in-one Super App for the informal economy. We scale by capturing value at every step: trades, loans, and logistics. This is our path to becoming the high-growth, multi-million company for this globally ignored $3 trillion market.
‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Setup & Installation)
To run the prototype locally:
Prerequisites:
 * Node.js (v18+)
 * NPM
 * Git
 * A Firebase Account (for backend functions)
 * A Hedera Testnet Account (with ACCOUNT_ID and PRIVATE_KEY for the admin/operator)
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]
cd project-integro

2. Backend Setup (Firebase Functions):
cd functions
npm install

 * Create an .env file in the functions directory.
 * Add your Hedera operator account credentials:
   OPERATOR_ID=[Your_Account_ID]
OPERATOR_KEY=[Your_Private_Key]

 * Set up your Firebase project and log in.
3. Frontend Setup (React App):
cd ../client  # (Or wherever your client app is)
npm install

 * In the React app, configure the ContractId (for the deployed Escrow.sol) and the Firebase function URLs.
4. Run the App:
 * (In one terminal) Deploy your Firebase functions: firebase deploy --only functions
 * (In another terminal) Start the React app: npm start
