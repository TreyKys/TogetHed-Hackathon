**`fix(wallet)`: Reverted to Official WalletConnect and Merged Full UI**

**1. Diagnosis:**
   - A regression was introduced in the previous commit, accidentally re-implementing the deprecated `HashConnect` library instead of the working `WalletConnect` solution. This caused a complete failure of the wallet connection logic.

**2. Changes Made:**
   - **Corrected Wallet Logic:** The entire wallet connection system in `App.jsx` was reverted back to the official, working implementation using `@walletconnect/sign-client` and `@walletconnect/modal`. This is the definitive and correct architecture for our app.
   - **Integrated Full UI Skeleton:** The new UI components for the Marketplace, USSD Simulator, Agent Zone, and Lending Pool, along with the bottom navigation bar, were successfully merged into the working `App.jsx` file.

**3. Solution:**
   - By combining the proven WalletConnect logic with the new UI structure, the application is now in a stable, functional state.

**4. Status:**
   - **Wallet connection is working again.** The full application UI is now visible and navigable. The project is back on the correct technical foundation and is ready for smart contract integration.
